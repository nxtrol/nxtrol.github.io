| T8193      | Communication timeout                                        | The communication with the target system failed because there is no answer from the system itself. More common causes of this problem are wrong cable connection, invalid target address in communication settings, invalid settings of communication parameters (such as baud rate), target system failure. |
| T8194      | Incompatible target version                                  | Error code not used.                                         |
| T8195      | Invalid code file                                            | The target system image file (with IMG extension) is invalid or corrupted. Try to upload and create new version of the image file using the "Communication Upload image file" menu option. |
| T8196      | Invalid data block index                                     | The image file (with IMG extension) contains a data block that has an index greater than the largest index supported by the target system. Try to upload and create new version of the image file using the "Communication Upload image file" menu option. If the problem persist, contact the target system vendor. |
| T8197      | Invalid target information address                           | Internal compiler error.                                     |
| T8198      | Flash erase failure                                          | The target system was not able to complete the flash erasure procedure. Contact the target system vendor for details. |
| T8199      | Code write failure                                           | The target system was not able to complete the flash programming procedure. Contact the target system vendor for details. |
| T8200      | Communication device unavailable                             | The compiler tried to communicate with the target system but the communication channel is not available. If the problem persist and there are other applications that communicate with the target system, deactivate the communication on the other applications and try again. |
| T8201      | Invalid function index                                       | Internal compiler error.                                     |
| T8202      | Invalid database information address                         | The address of the parameter's database memory area of the target system isn't correct or valid. Try to upload and create new version of the image file using the "Communication Upload image file" menu option. |
| T8203      | Invalid target information                                   |                                                              |
